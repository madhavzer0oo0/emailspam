# emailspam
Built an end-to-end machine learning application to classify emails as spam or not spam
using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Applied natural language processing
(NLP) techniques such as tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization. Achieved ~96%
accuracy and deployed the model using Flask.
